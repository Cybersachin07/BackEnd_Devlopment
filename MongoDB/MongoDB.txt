MongoDB

- It is open source and cross platform NON-SQL database.
- It is document oriented and semi-structured database.
- Document oriented allows to handle schema less content.
- It supports ORM [Object Relational Mapping].
- ORM introduces features like  lazy loading, change tracking, identity resolution etc.
- It supports AD-HOC querying. [Dynamic Queries]
- It supports Indexing. [It doesn't require a primary key field]
- It supports data replications, which enable to handle load.

Issues with MongoDB:
- It is structured less.
- It is non-relational
- It is not great for data predictions and analytics.

Creating a new Database
	
    create		: It is used to create various database objects like
				database,
				view,	
				stored procedure 
				trigger etc.
Syntax:
	create  database  databaseName;
	create  schema    databaseName;
Ex:
	create database  shopping;

2. Select database to start using it

Syntax:
		use  databaseName;
		use  shopping;

						MySQL Tables
- Table provides a schema to store data in rows and columns.
- You can use "create" command for creating a new table.

Syntax:
		create  table  table_name
		(

		)

- Table comprises of fields with following details

		a) field name
		b) data type
		c) constraint 

Syntax:
	   create  table  table_name
	   (
	       field_name  data_type   constraint,
	   )

- MySQL data type determines the type of value you can store in a field. Some of the popular MySQL types are 
	
   Number Types:
			INT				Signed & Unsinged
			Decimal()			Float, double, decimal 
			Float			Float
			Double			Double 

  String Type:
			VARCHAR
			LONGTEXT
			MEDIUMTEXT
			CHAR
   
  Date & Time Type:

			DATE
			TIME
			DATETIME
			YEAR

  Boolean Type: [There is no specific Boolean type in MySQL]

			TINYINT 		0 = false, 1 = true

  


Syntax:
	
		create  table  tblproducts
		(
		    ProductId  INT,
		    Name  VARCHAR(30),
		    Price    Decimal(6),
		    Stock   TINYINT,
		    Mfd      DATE
		)

MySQL Constraints:
- Constraint controls the behavior of field and its value.
- MySQL table field can use various types of constraints.

		1. Primary Key
		2. Unique Key
		3. Foreign Key
		4. Check
		5. Not Null
		6. Default 

Primary Key Constraint:
- Every record in database table requires a unique identification.
- It is used for querying and manipulating specific record. 
- Every table can have only one primary field.

Unique Key Constraint:
- A database table requires few fields with unique values.
- The value given for one record can't be used for another record. 
- You can't have multiple primary keys in a table.
- Hence a unique key constraint can be used for field.
- Table can have multiple unique key fields.

Check Constraint:
- It is used to check the input value by matching with any expression.
- It allows to store value into field only when it is matching the given expression. 
- It uses a validator to validate the input value.
- It ensures that contradictory and unauthorized data is not get stored into database.

Default Constraint:
- It is used to configure a default value for field.
- If a value is not provides for field in database table, then it is set to null.
- You can avoid null and use a default value to store by using default constraint. 

Not Null Constraint:
- It ensures that the field is not empty.
- It will not allow null. 
- It is used for required fields. 
- If a default value or explicit value is not defined then it will not allow to save data.

Foreign Key Constraint:
- It configures the relation ship between fields from multiple tables.
- It is a primary of a table used as a reference in another table.
- You can have multiple foreign keys to configure various relation ships like

	a) One-to-One
	b) One-to-Many
	c) Many-to-Many

Syntax:
	create table  tblProducts
	(
	  ProductId   INT  Primary Key,
	  Name varchar(30),
	  Price decimal(6,2),
	  Mfd  Date
	)

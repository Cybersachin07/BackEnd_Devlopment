What is database?
What are various types of databases?

Database Models:
- Every software application is built with a set of modules. 
- Each module have different roles and responsibilities. 
- Every module doesn't require data to maintain.
- Developer have to identify the modules that require data and design database models
	
	a) Conceptual Model
	b) Physical Model
	c) Logical Model
	d) Entity Model

Conceptual Model
- It comprises of a list of modules that require data.
- It is a database model for initializing the data requirements. 

Syntax:
		admin
		user
		product

Physical Model
- It comprises of information or data related to each module.
- It is a database model that contains information about the fields and their data type.

Syntax:
		tbladmin
			admin_id [number]
			admin_name[string]
			password [string]

		 tblproduct
			product_id [number]
			name [ string ]
			price [ number ]
			rating [number]

Logical Model
- It contains information about relationship between modules.
- It is a database model to configure relationship using Primary & Foreign Key.

		tblProduct
			product_id [PK]
			name 
			CategoryId [FK]

		tblCategory	
			category_id [PK]
			name

Entity Model
- It is the complete business model.
- Entity refers to business requirements.
- It is a database model that comprises of details like table, field, data type, relationship etc.
- It is a blue print for designing database. 
- The final model is known as "Entity Relationship Diagram".

Syntax:
	 tblcategory
		category_id : number [PK]
		name : string
	
	 tblproduct
		product_id : number [PK]
		name : string
		category_id: number [FK - reference tblCategory]
